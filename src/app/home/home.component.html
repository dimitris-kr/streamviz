    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
      The streaming era has revolutionized the way people access movies, series etc. as well as the way the
      entertainment business works. This project offers data visualizations concerning the content, revenue,
      and subscribers of various streaming platforms, to acquire knowledge regarding the differences in what
      they offer, possible trends, and their growth over time.

        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <div class="divider w-50 mt-2 mb-3 d-block"></div>
        <p>
          Streaming platforms are becoming increasingly popular nowadays. People are able to choose from an abundant
          catalogue of movies and series and watch whenever and wherever they desire. Therefore, due to this great
          convenience and a low cost, streaming is becoming the standard way of consuming media. That's why we chose to
          analyse this phenomenon through data visualization.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4 d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-center p-4">
        <h4>Objective & Goals</h4>
        <div class="divider w-50 mt-2 mb-3 d-block"></div>
        <p>
          We attempted to find tensions, about the possible relation between movie characteristics, for instance we
          tried to show if the year that a movie was produced affects the rating of that movie, or if the genre of the
          movie affects the review of the movie. We chose to look for such tensions, as searching for relations between
          variables, is a standard practice in data science. Except for this, it is useful also for the people working
          for the streaming platforms to know if the majority of people prefer a movie with a specific characteristic.
          Another goal that we want to achieve with this project, is to inform the audience about which platform is
          better, which is something that misses from the existing datasets, as till now there is only the information
          concerning the revenues and the subscribers of the platforms.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-4 d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-center p-4">
        <h4>Data Processing </h4>
        <div class="divider w-50 mt-2 mb-3 d-block"></div>
        <p>A difficulty that we faced during the processing of the streaming platforms datasets, was that in these
          datasets there was no recent data and the datasets had only information about streaming platformsâ€™ revenues
          and subscribers until 2020. So, we overcame this difficulty by searching in Google and by typing manually the
          numbers we saw, in a new dataset in an Excel file. For the datasets including information about the Streaming
          Services (revenues and subscribers), we calculated the sum of the revenues and subscribers of each platform,
          in order to find which one outperforms the others. For the datasets which are related to the ratings and other
          characteristics of movies and TV-shows, we compared the ratings among the movies and we tried to find
          relations between movie attributes, for example between the genre and the review of the movie. </p>
