  "The third graph shows the relation between the average IMDB score and the seriesâ€™ genre. One observation made, was that HBO Max holds the first place in most of the categories (10 out of 17), whereas Netflix is consistently low throughout the different categories with only 2 first places.",
  "In comparison to all the data presented, we observe that although Netflix offers a larger quantity of content compared to other platforms, HBO MAX excels in almost all categories in terms of ratings. However, Netflix remains the dominant platform."]
